    <h2 style="color:red;">VIRAT KOHLI</h2>
    <p><strong>Virat Kohli</strong> (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer who
        currently plays
        Test cricket and ODI cricket for India. Kohli is a former T20I player and a former captain of the
        Indian
        national cricket
        team. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler. He currently
        represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. He holds the record
        as the
        highest run-scorer in IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in
        international cricket. He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and
        stands
        second in the list of most international centuries scored. Hence, Kohli is widely regarded as one of
        the
        greatest batsmen of all time and the modern era. Kohli was a key member of the Indian team that won
        the 2011
        Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained India to win the ICC

        three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.

        After winning the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup, Kohli announced his retirement from T20I.</p>
